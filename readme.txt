Ever want to reply to someone else's post with a post on your own site? Or to "like" someone else's post, but with your own site?

== Description == 

Post Kinds adds support for responding to and interacting with other sites using the standards
developed by the IndieWeb by implementing
[kinds of posts](http://indieweb.org/post_kinds).

It can also distinguish certain types of passive posts in a manner similar to [post formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats).

== Screenshots ==

1. Here is an example of what a like looks like
2. Here is a reply to a Youtube video

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? = 

1. Bob wants to reply to Sue on his own website.
2. Sue enables webmentions(separate plugin) on her site.
3. Bob creates a post and sets it as a reply to or a like of Sue's post.
4. A webmention is sent to Sue's site, and stored as a comment on Sue's post.

= How do I learn more? =

For more information on the Indieweb and tools for WordPress, visit [Getting Started on
WordPress](http://indieweb.org/Getting_Started_on_WordPress).

= How do I get support? = 

The Development version of the plugin is hosted at [Github](https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-post-kinds). You can file issues there.

== Installation ==

The plugin requires the [webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/) plugin to support sending/receiving notice of a reply/like to another site which will appear as a comment. The [Semantic Linkbacks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks/) plugin is available to more richly display the comment.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 2.5.0 =

Settings have been completely changed and you will have to reset.

= 2.4.2 =

Due to changes in the Micropub plugin, multiple values for properties are now supported. 
Until this feature is supported in this plugin it will only look at the first value and ignore the others.

= 2.4.0 = 

I have changed the icons again, to go back to something closer to the original. If anyone wants to
contribute alternate icon sets for the project, willing to consider adding them. Also, coming up is
another change to how the plugin stores and works with data to continue to move toward something
closer to Microformats. Looking at a JF2 representation.

= 2.0.0 = 

This version makes some changes to the presentation. Backup your installation
first as a precaution. Lots of changes under the hood which will bear fruit in future.

= 1.2.0 =
This version migrates data to a new storage formats. Backup your installation
first as a precaution.

== Post Kinds ==

Many sites will not need all of the kinds set up. What kinds of posts you wish
to publish are specific to your needs.

You can enable/disable more based on preference. Some may be enabled by plugins.

Not having a post kind enabled will not disable the functionality on existing 
posts, it only hides the selection in adding new posts.

= The Non-Response Kinds =

These kinds have an analog in post formats. Adding context to one of these
may make it a Passive Kind.

 * **Article** - traditional long form content - a post with an explicit post name(title)
 * **Note** - short content - a post with just plain content (also the default)
 * **Photo** - image or photo post - a post with an embedded image as its primary focus. This uses either the featured image or attached images

= The Response Kinds =

 * **Reply** - Replying to someone else's comment
 * **Repost** - a complete repost of someone else's content
 * **Like** -  props/compliments to the original post/poster
 * **Favorite** - special to the favoriter
 * **Bookmark** - This is basically sharing/storing a link/bookmark. 
 * **Quote** - Quoted Content
 * **RSVP** - A specific type of Reply regarding an event

= The Passive Kinds =

To "Scrobble" a song is when listening to it, you would make it a post on
your website. This is the most well-known example of a passive kind of post.

They are formed by having content in the context box on one of these types of
posts.

 * **Listen** - scrobble - listening to an audio post 
 * **Jam** - Indicating a particularly personally meaningful song
 * **Watch** - video - watching a video
 * **Play** - playing a game
 * **Read** - reading a book, compared to online material

= Reserved =

The following Kinds are reserved for future use but will not show up in the 
interface at this time.

 * **Wish** - a post indicating a desire/wish. The archive of which would be
  a wishlist, such as a gift registry or similar. 
 * **Weather** - A weather post would be current weather conditions
 * **Exercise** - Representing some form of physical activity
 * **Trip** - Representing a trip...this represents a geographic journey and would require location awareness.
 * **Itinerary** - Itinerary - this would refer to scheduled transit, plane, train, etc. and does not require location awareness
 * **Check-In** - Identifying you are at a place. This would use the extended WordPress Geodata. It will require the Simple Location plugin to add location awareness to posts.
 * **Tag** - Allows you to tag a post as being of a specific tag, or person tagging.
 * **Eat** - Representing recording what you eat, perhaps for a food diary
 * **Drink** - Similar to Eat
 * **Follow** - A post indicating you are now following someone's activities
 * **Mood** - Mood - Feeling
 * **Recipe** - Recipe

== Archive Display ==

Post Kinds automatically handles the display of archives of individual types. So to view all the posts marked as "note", for example, one could visit the URL http://www.YOURSITE.COM/kind/note/. 
Simply replace YOURSITE.COM with your particular site name and the particular post kind name to access the others.

== RSS == 

Post Kinds also automatically handles RSS feeds which can be made available or subscribed to for any of the particular kinds. The RSS feed for all the posts marked as "note", for example could be found at either the URL `http://www.example.com/kind/note/feed` or  `http://www.example.com/feed/?kind=note` (if one doesn't have pretty permalinks enabled). Others can be obtained by replacing "note" with the other kinds.

== Bookmarklet Configuration ==

* If you add `?kindurl=URL` to the post editor URL, it will automatically fill this into the URL box in post properties
* If you add `?kind=like` to the post editor URL, it will automatically set the kind.

So - `https://www.example.com/wp-admin/post-new.php?kindurl=URL&kind=like` will automatically set a like with the URL

== SNAP ==

Post Kinds had support for replying to Twitter posts using the Social Network Auto Poster plugin. The developers of that plugin have not contacted the
developer of this plugin.

== Theme Support ==

Post Kinds automatically adds information to `the_content` and `the_excerpt` filter. Being as this is inside the content block, which may or may not be desirable, you may remove these filters as noted
below and call `kind_display` directly. This will allow it to appear outside the content block.
	* `remove_filter( 'the_content', array( 'Kind_View', 'content_response' ), 20 );`
	* `remove_filter( 'the_excerpt', array( 'Kind_View', 'excerpt_response' ), 20 );`

The functions `has_post_kind`, `set_post_kind`, and `set_post_kind` will allow you to manipulate the kind settings in a post. `get_post_kind_string` will return the display name of a kind.

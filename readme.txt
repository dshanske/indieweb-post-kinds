Ever want to reply to someone else's post with a post on your own site? Or to "like" someone else's post, but with your own site?

== Description == 

Post Kinds adds support for responding to and interacting with other sites using the standards developed by IndieWebCamp by implementing
[kinds of posts](http://indiewebcamp.com/post_kinds).

It can also distinguish certain types of passive posts in a manner similar to [post formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats).

== Screenshots ==

1. Here is an example of what a like looks like
2. Here is a reply to a Youtube video

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? = 

1. Bob wants to reply to Sue on his own website.
2. Sue enables webmentions(separate plugin) on her site.
3. Bob creates a post and sets it as a reply to or a like of Sue's post.
4. A webmention is sent to Sue's site, and stored as a comment on Sue's post.

= How do I get support? = 

The Development version of the plugin is hosted at [Github](https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-post-kinds).

== Installation ==

The plugin requires the [webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/) plugin to support sending/receiving notice of a reply/like to another site which will appear as a comment. The [Semantic Linkbacks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks/) plugin is available to more richly display the comment.

To declare your theme supports post kinds(if it does):

add_theme_support('post-kinds');

If your theme does not declare support, then the context information will be added to the content. It is assumed if your theme declares support, it is
responsible for display.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.2.0 =
This version migrates data to a new storage formats. Backup your installation
first as a precaution.

== Post Kinds ==

Many sites will not need all of the kinds set up. What kinds of posts you wish
to publish are specific to your needs.

By default, only note, article, photo and reply are enabled so you can get used to them.

You can add Media Check-Ins(watching or listening), or Link Sharing(likes, favorites, or bookmark) directly from the settings page.

You can enable/disable more based on preference. Some may be enabled by plugins.

Not having a post kind enabled will not disable the functionality on existing 
posts.

There is also a filter to do this on the fly.

= The Non-Response Kinds =

These kinds have an analog in post formats. Adding context to one of these
may make it a Passive Kind.

 * **Article** - traditional long form content - a post with an explicit post name(title)
 * **Note** - short content - a post with just plain content
 * **Photo** - image or photo post - a post with an embedded image as its primary focus

= The Response Kinds =

 * **Reply** - Replying to someone else's comment
 * **Repost** - a complete repost of someone else's content
 * **Like** -  props/compliments to the original post/poster
 * **Favorite** - special to the favoriter
 * **Bookmark** - also known as a linkblog. This is basically sharing/storing a link/bookmark.
 * **Tag** - Allows you to tag a post as being of a specific tag, or person tagging.
 * **RSVP** - A specific type of Reply regarding an event (Under Development)

= The Passive Kinds =

To "Scrobble" a song is when listening to it, you would make it a post on
your website. This is the most well-known example of a passive kind of post.

They are formed by having content in the context box on one of these types of
posts.

 * **Listen** - scrobble - listening to an audio post 
 * **Watch** - video - watching a video
 * **Play** - playing a game (Under Development)
 * **Wish** - a post indicating a desire/wish. The archive of which would be
	a wishlist, such as a gift registry or similar. (Under Development)
 * **Weather** - A weather post would be current weather conditions
 * **Exercise** - Representing some form of physical activity
 * **Travel** - Representing a trip
 * **Check-In** - Identifying you are at a place. This would use the extended WordPress Geodata.
   It will require the Simple Location plugin to add location awareness to posts.(Under Development)


= Future Kinds =

With the recent expansion of kinds into passive types of posts, there may be
additional ones added. Feedback appreciated.

== Future Plans ==

	* Contextual response box, hiding/changing options based on Kind selected. Example, an RSVP that shows Yes/No/Maybe.
	* Finish rewrite object oriented rewrite
	* Support Micropub plugin
	* Turn Kind Meta functions into class that also uses post meta as an alternative to
		the Kind taxonomy to derive types by checking for post meta types other than mf2_cite.
	* Add parsing capability from Indie-Webactions plugin into Post Kinds in a way to avoid
		duplication


== MultiKind Support (Experimental) ==

By request, multikind support has returned as a hidden mode that is not complete.

By design, the plugin only allows one kind to be selected per post. Setting 
this flag in your wp-config would change that.

define('MULTIKIND', '1');

== SNAP ==

Indieweb Post Kinds already has support for replying to Twitter posts using the Social Network Auto Poster plugin.

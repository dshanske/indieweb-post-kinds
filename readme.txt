Ever want to reply to someone else's post with a post on your own site? Or to "like" someone else's post, but with your own site?

== Description == 

Post Kinds adds support to the Classic Editor for responding to and interacting with other sites using the standards
developed by the IndieWeb by implementing [kinds of posts](http://indieweb.org/post_kinds). It is not compatible with Gutenberg.

It can also distinguish certain types of passive posts in a manner similar to [post formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats). While it can work alongside
post formats, it is recommended as a replacement as it is designed as a replacement using IndieWeb Post Types.

Many sites will not need all of the kinds set up. What kinds of posts you wish to publish are specific to your needs.


== Screenshots ==

1. Here is an example of what a like looks like
2. Here is a reply to a Youtube video

== Installation ==

The plugin requires the [webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/) plugin to support sending/receiving notice of a reply/like to another site which will appear as a comment. The [Semantic Linkbacks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks/) plugin is available to more richly display received comments.

== Privacy and Data Storage Notice ==

Post Kinds stores extra data in a post indicating what you are responding to. This data is either hand-added or can be parsed from the source URL if provided. This means you have additional
responsibilities to responsibly use this data, and to remove information on request.

==  Credits ==

2. [Chris Aldrich](http://boffosocko.com) always receives a credit on my plugins due his regular feedback, input, and usage.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 3.6.0 =

This version introduces the ability to filter kinds from the main feed and introduces a second feed that has all kinds, called the 'firehose' feed, available by default at /firehose. 
This feature could have unanticipated interactions with other plugins. Please report any issues so they can be addressed.

= 3.5.0 =

On This Day and Updated Functionality has been moved into its own plugin, Tempus Fugit, along with various other time based functionality from my plugins. You will have to install that plugin
to get these features.

= 3.3.0 =
Media metadata storage has been moved into the attachment as opposed to being stored in the post itself. This may have some unexpected effects. Please report if needed. The next version will
improve presentation by adding custom media gallery generation functionality.

= 3.1.4 =
This version is compatible with 5.0 of WordPress but is not integrated with the Gutenberg editor and requires the Classic Editor to function correctly.

= 3.1.1 =
* Bugs were reported in 3.1.0 and this is a quick fix for the ones initially reported

= 3.1.0 =

* Custom post kind registration, previously done by filter, is now done by registration. This will cause issues who had been using the filter. Due to a particular
user who created many custom kinds, decided to create a better way to do this. 
* Posting capability via custom REST API endpoint has been removed due improved Micropub support
* Kind_Meta class deprecated as promiseda
* Media Data is no longer stored in the post instead being stored in the attachment
* This version introduces a lot of base changes. Before making additional ones will be releasing this version so that things can stabilize

= 3.0.0 = 

Major refactoring of the plugin. The interface has been completely changed to improve simplicity. Please submit all bugs to our Github page.

= 2.7.0 = 

Storage locations have now changed as part of the nested properties settings and things should migrate automatically but pleasse backup before upgrade.
Kind_Meta function is deprecated and will be removed in 2.8.0, so if you depend on this, please update to use MF2_Post

= 2.5.0 =

Settings have been completely changed and you will have to reset.

= 2.4.2 =

Due to changes in the Micropub plugin, multiple values for properties are now supported. 
Until this feature is supported in this plugin it will only look at the first value and ignore the others.

= 2.4.0 = 

I have changed the icons again, to go back to something closer to the original. If anyone wants to
contribute alternate icon sets for the project, willing to consider adding them. Also, coming up is
another change to how the plugin stores and works with data to continue to move toward something
closer to Microformats. Looking at a JF2 representation.

= 2.0.0 = 

This version makes some changes to the presentation. Backup your installation
first as a precaution. Lots of changes under the hood which will bear fruit in future.

= 1.2.0 =
This version migrates data to a new storage formats. Backup your installation
first as a precaution.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? = 

Kinds, like Post Formats built into WordPress, allow you to specify that a post contains a certain type of content. It also, based
on you classifying it that way, displays it appropriately and marks it up accordingly so outside sites can identify it. Kinds are
either a response to something, such as a URL, or a more passive type of post where you are recording/logging something you did, for 
example, watched a movie. 

= How do I interact with other sites? =

This is added by webmention support.

1. Bob wants to reply to Sue on his own website.
2. Sue enables webmentions(separate plugin) on her site.
3. Bob creates a post and sets it as a reply to or a like of Sue's post.
4. A webmention is sent to Sue's site, and Sue's site uses the markup added by this plugin to determine what kind of post it is.
5. Sue's site stores and displays data from the post as a comment on Sue's post.

= How do I learn more? =

For more information on the Indieweb and tools for WordPress, visit [Getting Started on
WordPress](http://indieweb.org/Getting_Started_on_WordPress).

= There are too many Post Kinds =

You can enable/disable more based on preference. Some may be enabled by plugins. You do not have to use ones you don't want. Not having a post kind enabled 
will not disable the functionality on existing posts, it only hides the selection in adding new posts.

= What are the kinds of posts I can make? =

These kinds have an analog in post formats. Adding context to one of these may make it a Passive Kind.

 * **Article** - traditional long form content - a post with an explicit post name(title)
 * **Note** - short content - a post with just plain content (also the default)
 * **Photo** - image or photo post - a post with an embedded image as its primary focus. This uses either the featured image or attached images depending on theme.
 * **Video** - video post - a post with an embedded image as its primary focus.
 * **Audio** - audio post - a post with an embedded sound file as its primary focus.

The Response Kinds

 * **Reply** - Replying to someone else's comment
 * **Repost** - a complete repost of someone else's content
 * **Like** -  props/compliments to the original post/poster
 * **Favorite** - special to the favoriter
 * **Bookmark** - This is basically sharing/storing a link/bookmark. 
 * **Quote** - Quoted Content
 * **RSVP** - A specific type of Reply regarding an event
 * **Check-In** - Identifying you are at a place. To show full location, the Simple Location plugin is recommended as it will display maps.
 * **Issue** - Issue is a special kind of article post that is a reply to typically some source code, though potentially anything at a source control repository.


The Passive Kinds

To "Scrobble" a song is when listening to it, you would make it a post on
your website. This is the most well-known example of a passive kind of post. They are formed by having content in the context box on one of these types of
posts.

 * **Listen** - scrobble - listening to an audio post 
 * **Jam** - Indicating a particularly personally meaningful song
 * **Watch** - video - watching a video
 * **Play** - playing a game
 * **Craft** - making something...such as 3D printing, crafting, etc.
 * **Read** - reading a book, compared to online material
 * **Eat** - Representing recording what you eat, perhaps for a food diary
 * **Drink** - Similar to Eat

= What kinds do you plan to add in the future? =

The following Kinds are reserved for future use but will not show up in the 
interface at this time.

 * **Wish** - a post indicating a desire/wish. The archive of which would be
  a wishlist, such as a gift registry or similar. 
 * **Weather** - A weather post would be current weather conditions
 * **Exercise** - Representing some form of physical activity
 * **Trip** - Representing a trip...this represents a geographic journey and would require location awareness.
 * **Itinerary** - Itinerary - this would refer to scheduled transit, plane, train, etc. and does not require location awareness
 * **Tag** - Allows you to tag a post as being of a specific tag, or person tagging.
 * **Follow** - A post indicating you are now following someone's activities
 * **Mood** - Mood - Feeling
 * **Recipe** - Recipe
 * **Event** - An event is a type of post that in addition to a post name (event title) has a start datetime (likely end datetime), and a location.
 * **Sleep** - Sleep is a passive metrics post type that indicates how much time (and often a graph of how deeply) a person has slept.
 * **Acquisition** - Purchased, Donated, or otherwise acquired an object
 * **Question** - Question is a post type for soliciting answer replies, which are then typically up/down voted by others and then displayed underneath the question post ordered by highest positive vote count rather than time ordered.

= Can I add my own kinds? = 

I would prefer if something is popular enough to merge it into the plugin. Feel free to ask for a term to be reserved by filing an issue.
However if you are interested in creating your own there is functionality around it.

register_post_kind(
	'reply',
		array(
			'singular_name'   => __( 'Reply', 'indieweb-post-kinds' ), // Name for one instance of the kind
			'name'            => __( 'Replies', 'indieweb-post-kinds' ), // General name for the kind plural
		       	'verb'            => __( 'Replied to', 'indieweb-post-kinds' ), // The string for the verb or action (liked this)
			'property'        => 'in-reply-to', // microformats 2 property
                        'format'          => 'link', // Post Format that maps to this
                        'description'     => __( 'a reply to content typically on another site', 'indieweb-post-kinds' ),
                        'description-url' => 'http://indieweb.org/reply',
                        'title'           => false, // Should this kind have an explicit title
                        'show'            => true, // Show in Settings
                        )
		)
);

Add a function with your kind in the above format, hooking it in the init hook and it will add the Kind to the system. 

= Can I enable one of the Kinds you plan to offer in future? =

`set_post_kind_visibility( $slug, $show = true )` - If you add this function in early on, it will change the visibility of a kind.

= Can I create archives for each kind? ==

Post Kinds automatically handles the display of archives of individual types. So to view all the posts marked as "note", for example, one could visit the URL http://www.YOURSITE.COM/kind/note/. 
Simply replace YOURSITE.COM with your particular site name and the particular post kind name to access the others.

You can also add the date /kind/note/2018/12/24 to see date-based archives. 

For archives if you add exclude_kind as a query variable it will exclude specific kinds from the query `?exclude=kind&exclude_terms=note`. You can also do this as /exclude/kind/note,checkin as it accepts multiple values

There is also a special photo photo included, using ?kind_photos=1 or /photos or /photos/yyyy or /photos/yyyy/mm or /photos/kind/note or any other taxonomy. This will use the photo enhancements introduced in 3.4.0 to only show photos from
all types of posts.

= Do you have RSS feeds for each kind? = 

Post Kinds also automatically handles RSS feeds which can be made available or subscribed to for any of the particular kinds. The RSS feed for all the posts marked as "note", for example could be found at either the URL `http://www.example.com/kind/note/feed` or  `http://www.example.com/feed/?kind=note` (if one doesn't have pretty permalinks enabled). Others can be obtained by replacing "note" with the other kinds.

= Do you support bookmarklets? =

At the moment, a fully automatic bookmarklet is not yet part of the plugin but you can send data directly to the Post Editor

* If you add `?kindurl=URL` to the post editor URL, it will automatically fill this into the URL box in post properties
* If you add `?kind=like` to the post editor URL, it will automatically set the kind.

So - `https://www.example.com/wp-admin/post-new.php?kindurl=URL&kind=like` will automatically set a like with the URL

= Can I post automatically outside the Post Editor? =

Using the [Micropub](https://wordpress.org/plugins/micropub) plugin for WordPress is the easiest way to post outside of the Post Editor. This will work with any Micropub client.

= I installed JetPack and I am no longer getting context added to my posts =

The JetPack sharing module conflicts with this plugin.

= When will this plugin support the Block Editor? =

I am not sure. It is not a strict priority. At this time, there is no definite time for this support. I have been gradually moving toward abstracting more of the data into the REST API
so it could more easily be added to the block editor.

= How do I get support? = 

The Development version of the plugin is hosted at [Github](https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-post-kinds). You can file issues there.


== Theme Support ==

Post Kinds automatically adds information to `the_content` and `the_excerpt` filter. Being as this is inside the content block, which may or may not be desirable, you may remove these filters as noted
below and call `kind_display` directly. This will allow it to appear outside the content block. To remove the automatic display, add the following to your theme.
	* `add_filter( 'kind_content_display', '__return_false' );`

The functions `has_post_kind`, `set_post_kind`, and `set_post_kind` will allow you to manipulate the kind settings in a post. `get_post_kind_string` will return the display name of a kind.

If you want to customize the look of the display, you can create a directory in your theme called `kind_views`, copy the file from the views directory of the plugin, and modify it. This will persist
through future plugin updates.
